# Profile

## Welcome to my website repo.

I am a self-taught software developer that found passion for software development during my time in college
going for Bahcelor of Aviation/Electronics Engineering.

### Why I choose these Technologies for my project ?

The tool I used to build this website was Vite.I will be honest that I had no idea
what vite or a tech stack was. I just knew that It could be used to build some config
and run a website.
Due to the curiosity nature in me, during my research I found out how fast Vite performance was
It made me confident that this would be a good base to start.

I also wanted to Learn some frameworks on my path to building this website,
as I was doing my internship during that time. I was experiencing a lot of React
for the first time. I wanted to improve and learn more about React
so I went with React for the project.

### What it taught me ?

I had a fantastic experience learning these technologies and incoporating
them with react. Of course it was tough at first because I was not a super advanced
programming kid but I knew with time and passion, anything is possible.

I wanted to make something of my own.It taught me a lot of things I had no idea I needed to know to make a modern website from ground up.

### What motivated me ?

The first thing that came to me was, if this was going to be my website. I would want
it to be maintainable and easy to read when I come back to it. This allows me to
easily explore new tech with this website. Improve it as
my journey of learning to be a developer goes on.

Feel free to explore and let me know what you think!
