### Why I choose these Tech Stack 

The tool I used to build this website was Vite. At that time vite seems to be
a very popular stack for React.
I also wanted to explore more frameworks on my path to building this website,
as I was doing my internship during that time. I was experiencing a lot of React.
At the same time I wanted to improve and learn more about React 
so I went with it for this project.

### What it taught me ?

I had a fantastic experience learning these technologies and incoporating
them with react. Ive always wanted to build something of my own. 
Of course it was tough at first because I was not a super advanced
programming kid but I knew its not impossible. The curiosity nature in me always
takes me into some sort of a rabbit hole until I eventually figure it out.
It taught me a lot of things I had no idea I needed to know to make a modern website from ground up.

### What motivated me ?

The first thing that came to me was, if this was going to be my website. I would want
it to be maintainable and easy to read when I come back to it. Clean code or
not, I dont really know. For me, having the code re-useable and easy to navigate is priority.
This allows me to easily explore new tech with this website. Improve it as
my journey of learning to become a frontend dev. 

Feel free to explore and reach out to me if you find anything that can be
improved. Im all about improving and growing.
